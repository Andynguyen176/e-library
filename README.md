# Electronic Library 

Hello user's, 

Welcome to the era of technology now. It's crazy right? We're able to do actvities straight from our mobile devices such as ordering coffee, catch an uber, or place an Amazon order. It continues to affect our daily lives and I'm excited for what else it has in stores for society in the future. Anyways, I wanted to try something different and create an online library database which allows user's to check-out, return, search, and review books straight from their computer.
